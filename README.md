# CityHire

The purpose of this project is to work in a group to develop a software system that allows hiring of electirc scooters in Leeds City Centre. The project should consist of three full sprints that are each 2 weeks long.

- Your solution should have a client-server architecture. It will be easiest to use HTTP as the base protocol for communication between clients and server, and this will also provide you with the most flexibility, but a TCP-based solution is acceptable.

- The server should interact with a database that stores details specific to the domain: for example, registered users, available scooters and locations, prices, and bookings. Ideally, this should be an SQL database.

- There are 2 required interfaces to the system: a customer and an employee/manager. 

- You solution should be tested throughout its development, and testing should be automated where possible.

- Make use of an agile development process.
